# Hacknite
An immersive cyber-world platformer where a robot must conquer three perilous challenges to regain its humanity. Collect diamonds, survive high-tech trials, and earn hearts to become human again.
## Human Again
In Human Again, players navigate through a vibrant cyber cityscape, where the protagonist, a robot, must conquer various challenges to regain its humanity. Each diamond collected serves as a key to access different challenges. The player must pass through high-tech trials and earn hearts. Losing in these challenges comes with consequences, either losing a heart or a life. If the player runs out of hearts or lives, or chooses not to use them, the journey ends. The player must collect all three hearts to restore humanity and win the game.
##Levels
### Moonryze
Set in a vibrant cyber city, this 2D platformer challenges players to leap across glass tiles that spawn at random heights from the right side of the screen. Navigate the ever-shifting skyline, using the tiles to stay afloat. Reach the far right edge of the screen to win and conquer the neon skyline.
### Cybersurge
The game features two types of traps in its cyber cityscape: one moves horizontally, the other vertically. Colliding with the horizontal trap delivers a jolt of electricity and triggers a screen shake. Touching the vertical trap shatters the player into flying fragments. Dodge all the traps flawlessly to secure victory.
### Synth City 
In this level, players must navigate through a futuristic cyber city, where danger lurks at every corner. The objective is to reach the finish line while avoiding deadly obstacles.
UFO Hazards: Moving UFOs patrol the area, continuously firing lethal lasers. Players must dodge these lasers to stay alive.
Spike Traps: The ground is littered with spike traps that periodically emerge. Players must jump over these traps to avoid taking damage.
Successfully navigating these obstacles will allow the player to reach the finish line and complete the level.
